Description: Provides R-implementation of Decision forest algorithm, which combines the predictions of
    multiple independent decision tree models for a consensus decision. In particular, Decision Forest is a novel 
    pattern-recognition method which can be used to analyze: (1) DNA microarray data; 
    (2) Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry  (SELDI-TOF-MS) data; and 
    (3) Structure-Activity Relation (SAR) data.
    In this package, three fundamental functions are provided, as (1)DF_train, (2)DF_pred, and (3)DF_CV.  
    run Dforest() to see more instructions.
